        <h1>Thire live's depend on <br> your donation</h1>
        <p>The Bangladesh Government continues to mobilize <br> resources to support the affected communities, <br> such as basic food, water purification tablets, <br> and cash grants. However, further support from charitable organizations <br> and development partners is still desperately needed. Due to <br> the power outage and the shortage of safe drinking water, many  <br> city-dwellers are buying bottled water at increased prices.</p>
